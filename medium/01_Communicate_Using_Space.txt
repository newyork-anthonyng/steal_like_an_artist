Lessons Learned
	1. Semantic HTML
	Semantic: relating to meaning in language or logic.

	In the context of HTML, being semantic means using the available tags for their god-given purpose, instead of creating div's and classes that do the same task.

	I used the <header> and <main> tags, and avoided using any <div> tags.

	2. Vanilla CSS
	I want to keep my code at a minimum, and that includes CSS.

	Vanilla CSS was enough for what I needed on this project and I didn't have to worry about the additional overhead of a (relatively) large CSS framework like Bootstrap. I found that when working with a CSS framework, you spend more time hacking !important to get the styles the way you want them.

	3. Media Queries
	With media queries, don't feel obligated to use the most popular breakpoints. Design your mobile layout first, then set breakpoints for when your design just starts looking like crap.

Improvements
	This was a simple design that I was happy with.
