Why this project?
1. My design skills are crap

2. Read "Steal Like An Artist" by Austin Kleon

3. Find "art" that I love and copy it shamelessly

4. Become a frankenstein of all artists you stole from

By doing this, I'll be working on a large number of projects in a short amount of time. I'll also be able to take a look at existing code and see how the pros do it.
