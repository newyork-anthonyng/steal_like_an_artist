Over the next year, I will be copying/reproducing designs and creating websites from them.

Why this project?

1. My design skills are crap

2. I read "Steal Like An Artist" by Austin Kleon. So now I'll...

3. Find "art" that I love and copy it shamelessly

4. Become a frankenstein of all artists I stole from.

By working on so many projects, hopefully I'll become a somewhat respectful designer.
