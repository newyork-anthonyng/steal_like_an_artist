04. A List Apart

Lessons Learned
1. David Kadavy
I signed up for David Kadavy's email newsletter, (http://designforhackers.com/blog/design-pitfalls-a-new-free-email-course-to-learn-design/)
I have only been through 3 of the 6 free lessons here, but his newsletters are aimed towards avoiding the common design pitfalls (as its name suggests). It teaches you this by limiting your choices. As a designer with a blank slate, you have infinite options. You can choose from so many different fonts, so many different font-sizes, so many different colors, etc. All of these choices can be overwhelming for a newbie, and crappy designs can result. A soup of a website might be created by mixing in as many colors, different font-sizes and fonts available.
Having a constraint on your choices also encourages creativity. Although it might sound counter-intuitive, by limiting what you can use in your designer palette, you come up with even more creative solutions. If you can only use 1 font family, how can you differentiate a header from a paragraph? If you can only use 2 different colors, how can you make a vibrant website?

2. Skeleton.css (http://getskeleton.com)
I used Skeleton.css, which is advertised as "dead simple, responsive boilerplate." It is only 400 lines of CSS, and gives you the basics of a 12 column responsive grid. Designing and developing while thinking in terms of columns definitely helps me with some of the layout of my code. Instead of thinking how many pixels I should add to two different columns of my code, I think about which columns the content should take up.

Thinking in terms of the grid might also limit some of your creativity. But like David Kadavy's newsletter suggested, having some limits will make you even more creative. And using a grid doesn't mean that you have to adhere to it strictly; these are just guidelines that can be broken.

Improvements
Although skeleton.css is very lightweight, it does come with some stylings of its own. It has its own styling for buttons and forms. I think they look amazing, but these styles go unused. I wonder if it's better to get keep a version of skeleton that is bare of all these unnecessary styles.
