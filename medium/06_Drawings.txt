Lessons Learned
1. Bezier Curves
Bezier curves are these tools in drawing applications that help you draw a curve. You click on a point, then drag these handles around to adjust the angle that the curve has. It's a pretty powerful tool, but it was hard for me to pick up. If I just needed a basic shape, bezier curves were a joy to work with. Anything more complicated, and it seemed like pulling teeth (or bezier handles) to get the curve perfectly the way I wanted it.

I went into using bezier curves without any prior knowledge or tutorials. I highly suggest taking a tutorial, because for me, bezier curves just didn't seem intuitive.

2. Thinking in Shapes
Because of my lack of drawing skills, I had to hack a lot of my drawing shapes. You can see that the bottom of the beard looks like a pentagon. I hacked that together by putting a triangle on top of a square; it did the trick. I felt like this was similar to thinking of React components; you can break the drawings down in a thousand different ways and get the same result. I'm really interested in seeing how a real experienced designer would've completed this.

Improvements
Practice! I definitely would've practiced more with bezier curves and the tool I was using (Affinity Designer). I also had a design send me this great game/tutorial, http://bezier.method.ac/, that takes you through the basics of bezier curves.
I have a drawing tablet, and I want to give a shot and drawing some designs using that. I like SVG's in that they're perfect, but when I'm actually drawing them, I find myself going OCD and trying to get every pixel right. I feel like hand-drawn art is nice and organic, and has a gritty feeling to it.
