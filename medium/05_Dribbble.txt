05. Dribbble

Lessons Learned
1. Spritesheets
-advantages
  -you combine multiple images into one large image
	-you might not save space
	-you make less requests which will save time
	-the down arrow
	-the menu hamburger item
	-the grid
-css styles
	-background-image
	-background-position
	-background-repeat

2. Box shadow generator
-confusing CSS properties out there
  -take a lot of arguments
-chrome dev tools are effective, but sometimes it's not the most efficient
-websites that generate the properties for you
  -http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow
	-you can play with values and have it update in real time
	-the UI to update the values is a lot friendlier than chrome dev tools
-there are other websites to generate other elements, like buttons

Improvements
-Incomplete project.
-I do plan on playing around with SVG's in the future, and populating this pseudo-Dribbble page with some of my creations.
-used the Sketch Measure plugin
  -should have been more detailed
	-found myself missing a lot of padding/margin/color values that I didn't think to include in the styleguide
  - I definitely see great value in this Styleguide. If I had to do it over again
